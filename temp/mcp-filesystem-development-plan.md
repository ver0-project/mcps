# MCP Filesystem Development Plan

## Overview of Current State

The `@ver0/mcp-filesystem` package currently has:
- Basic MCP server structure with SDK setup
- Empty tools directory - no filesystem tools implemented yet
- Basic package configuration (TypeScript, ESLint, Vitest)
- Placeholder README with no tool documentation
- Incorrect server name in index.ts (shows "mcp-http-fetch" instead of filesystem)
- Dependencies include `@minify-html/node` and `turndown` which are HTTP-related, not filesystem-related

## Overview of Final State

The completed package will provide:
- 12 filesystem operation tools accessible via MCP protocol
- Type-safe implementations using Zod validation
- Comprehensive error handling with clear error messages
- Security considerations (path validation, access controls)
- Full unit test coverage for all tools
- Updated documentation with tool descriptions and examples
- Proper server naming and dependencies

## Files to Change

### `src/index.ts`
- Fix server name from "mcp-http-fetch" to "mcp-filesystem"
- Register all 12 filesystem tools with the server
- Add proper error handling and server lifecycle management

### `src/tools/` (new files)
- `read.ts` - Single file reading with encoding support
- `read-many.ts` - Batch file reading with concurrent processing
- `write.ts` - Single file writing with encoding and create/overwrite options
- `write-many.ts` - Batch file writing with transaction-like behavior
- `list-directory.ts` - Directory listing with filtering and metadata options
- `stat.ts` - File/directory metadata retrieval (size, dates, permissions)
- `find.ts` - File/directory search by patterns and criteria
- `grep.ts` - Text search within files with pattern matching
- `mkdir.ts` - Create directories with recursive option and permission settings
- `diff-file.ts` - Compare files and show differences with various output formats
- `move.ts` - Move/rename files and directories with collision handling
- `copy.ts` - Copy files and directories with recursive and preserve options

### `src/types.ts`
- Add filesystem-specific type definitions
- Define common interfaces for file operations
- Add error types and validation schemas

### `package.json`
- Remove HTTP-related dependencies (`@minify-html/node`, `turndown`)
- Add filesystem-related dependencies if needed
- Update description and keywords

### `README.md`
- Add comprehensive tool documentation
- Include usage examples for each tool
- Add security considerations section
- Update installation instructions

### Test files (new)
- `src/tools/*.test.ts` - Unit tests for each tool
- Test file fixtures and mock filesystem scenarios
